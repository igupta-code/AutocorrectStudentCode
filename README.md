# Autocorrect
#### A word-suggestion project created by Zach Blick for Adventures in Algorithms at Menlo School in Atherton, CA and solved by Isha Gupta 
## Your goal
Create an autocorrect tool that runs continuously in the IntelliJ terminal. Once the program begins, it waits for the user to type a word into the console. If the word matches a dictionary word, nothing happens. But if the word is misspelled, the program will return the closest matching words. If no matching candidates can be found, the program prints "No matches found."

A tester file has been provided for you. It utilizes junit tests.
To use this test file, run either the entire thing or individual tests (one at a time).
There are five test cases, each of which will load data from [test number].txt, which is in the
test_files directory.

## My Program
My spellcheck prompts the user for a word to autocorrect. It returns whether it inputted word is spelt correctly or not. If not, it will suggest a list of similar words in the dictionary.
