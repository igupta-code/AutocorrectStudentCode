| March 5  | class |                                                      We got introduced to the problem set. We discussed a bit about how to narrow down the dictionary size: by using just the first letter or letters near the first letter. |
| March 7  | class | We tried figuring out ways to find the edit distance. The two ideas we came up with are using the longest common substring or using tabulation to find the edit distance. I feel like tabulation would be a better approach. |
| March 11 | class |                          I wrote a draft of a levenshtein method to find the shortest edit distance. I have to figure out how to either test it with the whole dictionary or to narrow down the dictionary first to test it. |
