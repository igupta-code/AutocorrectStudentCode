| March 5  |    class    |                                                                                                                                     We got introduced to the problem set. We discussed a bit about how to narrow down the dictionary size: by using just the first letter or letters near the first letter. |
| March 7  |    class    |                                                                                We tried figuring out ways to find the edit distance. The two ideas we came up with are using the longest common substring or using tabulation to find the edit distance. I feel like tabulation would be a better approach. |
| March 11 |    class    |                                                                                                         I wrote a draft of a levenshtein method to find the shortest edit distance. I have to figure out how to either test it with the whole dictionary or to narrow down the dictionary first to test it. |
| March 16 |  5-5:30pm   |                                                                I actually completely forgot what I did last class, so I am very grateful for my comments. I couldn't figure out how to get an arraylist to an array :(. But I just printed out my corrected words instead: I'm not getting all of them yet. |
| March 16 |  5:30-6pm   | I fixed some bugs! Turns out I'm supposed to be looking for anything less than or equal to the threshold, which explains the missing words. Then I was getting too many words because I wasn't checking the last letter of each word. So I increased the size of my table by 1 and shifted everything over. |
| March 17 |    class    |                                                                                                                                                                 I stared out on the hash map stuff for the n-grams. I reviewed some of the hashing slides from DNA and then started on the Horner's method. |
| March 17 |   9-9:45    |                  I was quite unproductive: mostly considering all the reasons why I didn't like the n-gram method, but also I don't have a better method so I guess we're going with this! I also fixed a bug: my map size for my letters map was too small. I also figured out how to sort alphabetically. |
| March 18 |   12:30-1   |                                                                                      Moved all the stuff for making my dictionary hashMap into the constructor so I am only doing it once. I also wrote out a rabin-karp that should, theoretically fill out the hash map. Not sure how to test that yet... |
| March 20 |  tutorial   |                                                                           I added some code in to fix the issue of words smaller than by n-gram length. I'm not sure how efficient it is, but I just add all words less than or equal to length 3 to my candidates array if my word is less than 6 letters. |
| March 20 | 10:30-11:15 |                                            I figured out how to sort everything properly: I store my final words in a map of arraylists (the index representing the edit distance). Then you can sort each index of the map individually and return in order (both alphabetically and edit distance based). |
