| March 5 | class |                                                     We got introduced to the problem set. We discussed a bit about how to narrow down the dictionary size: by using just the first letter or letters near the first letter.  |
| March 7 | class | We tried figuring out ways to find the edit distance. The two ideas we came up with are using the longest common substring or using tabulation to find the edit distance. I feel like tabulation would be a better approach. |
