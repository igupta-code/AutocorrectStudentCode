| March 5  |  class   |                                                                                                                                     We got introduced to the problem set. We discussed a bit about how to narrow down the dictionary size: by using just the first letter or letters near the first letter. |
| March 7  |  class   |                                                                                We tried figuring out ways to find the edit distance. The two ideas we came up with are using the longest common substring or using tabulation to find the edit distance. I feel like tabulation would be a better approach. |
| March 11 |  class   |                                                                                                         I wrote a draft of a levenshtein method to find the shortest edit distance. I have to figure out how to either test it with the whole dictionary or to narrow down the dictionary first to test it. |
| March 16 | 5-5:30pm |                                                                I actually completely forgot what I did last class, so I am very grateful for my comments. I couldn't figure out how to get an arraylist to an array :(. But I just printed out my corrected words instead: I'm not getting all of them yet. |
| March 16 | 5:30-6pm | I fixed some bugs! Turns out I'm supposed to be looking for anything less than or equal to the threshold, which explains the missing words. Then I was getting too many words because I wasn't checking the last letter of each word. So I increased the size of my table by 1 and shifted everything over. |
